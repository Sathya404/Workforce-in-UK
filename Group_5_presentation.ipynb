    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Workforce Analysis Application** is a comprehensive dashboard solution designed for workforce planning, analysis, and decision-making. \n",
    "The application integrates **Flask** for backend routing and multiple **Dash** dashboards for data visualization. \n",
    "By leveraging machine learning models, it provides actionable insights into workforce trends, gender distribution, regional statistics, \n",
    "industrial segmentation, full-time versus part-time job distribution, and time-series analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**  \n",
    "This application analyzes workforce data across the UK, offering insights into employment trends, regional distributions, and industry-specific details. It features five interactive dashboards:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Workforce Dashboard**: Displays occupational distributions across UK countries.  \n",
    "2. **Regional/Gender Dashboard**: Examines employment and unemployment by region and gender.  \n",
    "3. **Industrial Dashboard**: Highlights employment trends across industries and regions.  \n",
    "4. **Full-Time & Part-Time Dashboard**: Analyzes full-time vs. part-time employment.  \n",
    "5. **Time Series Dashboard**: Tracks employment trends over time.  \n",
