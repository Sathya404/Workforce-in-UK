### **Workforce Analysis of UK Application**  

## Introduction

The **Workforce Analysis Application** is a comprehensive dashboard solution designed for workforce planning, analysis, and decision-making.  
The application integrates **Flask** for backend routing and multiple **Dash** dashboards for data visualization.  
By leveraging machine learning models, it provides actionable insights into workforce trends, gender distribution, regional statistics,  
industrial segmentation, full-time versus part-time job distribution, and time-series analyses.

#### **Overview**  
This application analyzes workforce data across the UK, offering insights into employment trends, regional distributions, and industry-specific details. It features five interactive dashboards:  

1. **Workforce Dashboard**: Displays occupational distributions across UK countries.  
2. **Regional/Gender Dashboard**: Examines employment and unemployment by region and gender.  
3. **Industrial Dashboard**: Highlights employment trends across industries and regions.  
4. **Full-Time & Part-Time Dashboard**: Analyzes full-time vs. part-time employment.  
5. **Time Series Dashboard**: Tracks employment trends over time.

  - `full_part_utils.py`: Functions for analyzing full-time and part-time workforce trends.
  - `db_utils.py`: Utility functions for database operations, such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

---

#### **5. `__init__.py`**
- Marks the directory as a Python package.
- Typically initializes the application, sets up configurations, or imports submodules.

---

#### **6. `app.py`**
- The main Flask application setup file.
- Initializes the Dash apps and registers them with the Flask server.

---

#### **7. `main.py`**
- Entry point to start the application.
- Integrates the Flask app and the Dash dashboards.

---

#### **8. `config.py`**
- Stores configuration settings for the application, such as database credentials, API keys, and environment-specific variables.

---

#### **9. `requirements.txt`**
- Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the application.

---

### **How It Works**:
1. **Dashboards (`dashboards/`)**:
   Each script corresponds to a specific dashboard and uses the utility functions to process and visualize data.

2. **Utilities (`utils/`)**:
   Scripts here handle data preprocessing, making the dashboard scripts cleaner and more modular.

3. **Database (`db_files/`)**:
   The SQL file and GeoJSON data support the application's database layer, and the `sql_database.py` script interacts with the database.

4. **Application Initialization (`app.py`, `main.py`)**:
   These files set up the Flask-Dash integration, allowing dashboards to be served as web applications.

---

### **How to Start the Application**

To run the **Workforce Analysis of UK Application**, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Install Dependencies**  
Before starting, ensure you have all the required libraries installed:

```
pip install flask dash pandas plotly
```

#### 2. **Set Up the Flask and Dash Application**  
In your project directory, navigate to the folder containing the Python files and execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will start a Flask server and the Dashboards.

### **Data Wrangling Process**

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and preparing data for analysis. Here's how it was done for the various datasets:

#### 1. **Regional Data Wrangling** (from `regional_utils.py`)
```python
# Extract employment data by region
employment_df = pd.read_csv(WORKFORCE_BY_INDUSTRY_URL)

# Filter out unwanted geographies (Scotland and Wales are duplicated)
employment_df = employment_df[~employment_df['GEOGRAPHY'].isin(['2013265930', '2013265931'])]

# Keep relevant columns and filter data for 'Total' employment status
employment_by_regions = {}
for region in employment_df['GEOGRAPHY_NAME'].unique():
    employment_by_regions[region] = employment_df.loc[
        (employment_df['SEX_NAME'] == 'Total') & 
        (employment_df['GEOGRAPHY_NAME'] == region), 
        ['INDUSTRY_NAME', 'OBS_VALUE']
    ]
```
- **Key Steps**:
  - Loaded data using `pd.read_csv`.
  - Removed duplicate regions (Scotland and Wales).
  - Filtered data for total employment and grouped by region and industry.

#### 2. **Industrial Data Wrangling** (from `industrial_utils.py`)
```python
# Filter data by industry and gender
employment_df_initial = pd.read_csv(WORKFORCE_BY_INDUSTRY_URL)
employment_df = employment_df_initial[employment_df_initial['SEX_NAME'] != 'Total']

# Group data by industry and region
jobs_by_industry = {}
for industry in employment_df['INDUSTRY_NAME'].unique():
    jobs_by_industry[industry] = employment_df[employment_df['INDUSTRY_NAME'] == industry]
```
- **Key Steps**:
  - Loaded the dataset and filtered by gender (`SEX_NAME != 'Total'`).
  - Created a dictionary to store employment data by industry.

#### 3. **Full-Time and Part-Time Data Wrangling** (from `timeseries_utils.py`)
```python
# Extract timeseries data
data = pd.read_csv(TIMESERIES_API_URL)

# Clean data by removing rows with percentage values and unwanted geographies
timeseries_df = data[
    ~data['MEASURE_CODE'].isin([2]) &  # Remove industry percentage rows
    ~data['GEOGRAPHY'].isin(['2013265930', '2013265931'])  # Remove duplicate geographies
]
```
- **Key Steps**:
  - Loaded the timeseries data.
  - Removed rows with industry percentage data and unwanted geographical entries.
